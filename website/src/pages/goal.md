A website available to the public through which users have the ability to upload a video from space. This video is then processed by a program we've created (code name "**osscaar**"), which subsequently provides corresponding *audio for the visual elements*. Through this website we aim for broadening our perception of space data, but also including *accessibility* for visually impaired individuals. We believe that sonification has the potential to evolve into a fully-fledged field of study, as perceiving outer space through an alternative sense brings it closer to *human understanding*. The vastness of our universe can be daunting and difficult to comprehend, but by associating it with something familiar—our senses—we may develop a more comprehensive and profound understanding. And that’s how **Selenotone** was born!
We chose to implement our ideas through a website because of the increased level of accessibility: it can be used by *anyone*, be it an elementary school student, visually impaired citizen or astrophysics enthusiast.
