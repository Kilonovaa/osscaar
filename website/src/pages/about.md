title: About us
---
**Kilonova** is a team made up of 6 high school students passionate about technology, science, design, and innovation. Our first project together, **Selenotone**, is a statement of our devotion to making scientific advancements available to *everyone*, no matter how young or old, able or disabled, experienced or inexperienced they may be. We believe that knowledge should be accessible and approachable to all, and weâ€™re proud of our efforts to bridge the gap between cutting-edge research and the wider community.
